1. Handling post and other requests
2. chaining of requests
3. Serving HTML files
4. Installing Postman
5. Express Router

in this video we know about that how we handle the 
 
 GET,POST, DELETE and PUT request by using express.js

 or 

 know about chaining concept 

 or 

 how to serve static files in express.js


 we use POST request mostly 
    for ex : 
       suppose we have to fill the pass on the FB so we dont want to show my pass on the URL 
        and due to this reason we use post request 


GET req has limits of words which is 8192 bytes which is filled very soon 



why we use Postman and what is the use of it

so basically when we make too much API's and then we have to check it 
so a cheap method to make a HTML page and pass the information to that page 
so instead of using it we have to use the POSTMAN software 




how to serve HTML files 

so we make a template folder and make an index.html file



::: express Routes

it help to organize the things 

    :: for ex :-
         suppose we have a completed site and then we have to add a blog in it 
         so then we declare there / points like /blogs and many more so to avoid this
         we used express routes and the steps to make it 
         

         make a new folder and then make a new js file and then add the code of the routes to the main files of the javascript
