we can write our middlewares self 

why we ues middleware 

for ex 
   : we have mulitper middleware so
    the fist one is use to logger for our application

    what is middleware
      ek aesa function jo hr request se phle  chlega 
      or req ko modify bhi kr skta he 


      :: there are 5 tpes of middleware

      1. application level middleware
         jo app.use krke bnate he 

      2. Router level middleware
         jo hm particular router ke andar bnate he

      3. Error Handling middleware
         suppose en error comes so we do changes by using this error 

      4. Built-In middleware
           like we use express.static 
           means for Handling the static files

      5. Third party middleware
          like other one is write our middleware and then we use it using npm install
